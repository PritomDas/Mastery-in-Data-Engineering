You are in charge of a retailer’s data infrastructure. Let’s look at some business activities.

Customers should be able to find goods & make orders
Inventory Staff should be able to stock, retrieve, and re-order goods
Delivery Staff should be able to pick up & deliver goods
HR should be able to assess the performance of sales staff
Marketing should be able to see the effect of different sales channels
Management should be able to monitor sales growth
Ask yourself: Can I build a database to support these activities? Are all of the above questions of the same nature?
Let's take a closer look at details that may affect your data infrastructure.

Retailer has a nation-wide presence → Scale?
Acquired smaller retailers, brick & mortar shops, online store → Single database? Complexity?
Has support call center & social media accounts → Tabular data?
Customers, Inventory Staff and Delivery staff expect the system to be fast & stable → Performance
HR, Marketing & Sales Reports want a lot information but have not decided yet on everything they need → Clear Requirements?
Ok, maybe one single relational database won’t suffice :)
