a slightly older technology although still in use by some companies. Spark is generally faster than Hadoop, which is why Spark has become
more popular over the last few years.

There are many other big data tools and systems, each with its own use case. For example, there are database system like Apache Cassandra
and SQL query engines like Presto. But Spark is still one of the most popular tools for analyzing large data sets.
